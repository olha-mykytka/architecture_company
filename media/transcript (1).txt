Hi! Nice to meet you! My name is Olga. I am a student at Utah Valley University. I Study Web Design & App Development, with an emphasis in Interaction Design, as well as I have a minor in Event Planning. Originally from Ukraine, I moved to the United States about 8 years ago and I call Utah my second home now. I absolutely love UVU and its involvement; I am currently involved as a Foundation Ambassador here in school and it has been an amazing experience. I am really excited to be graduating next year! I have 2 more semesters to go after Spring 2025, so I am really excited about that. I would say that my favorite part about being a student here is.. is how involved I can get and all the opportunities that UVU creates for those who want those opportunities. Thank you, bye!
